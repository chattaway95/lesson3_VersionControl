## Assignment Date:

## Student Name:  
(Caitlin Hattaway)

## Project Description:
(This assignment had us create a repository using GitHub, create a webpage that summarized 5 Key concepts from the lesson, and had us push the final website into our repository.)

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned a lot about Github and VCSs, and how they function. I learned that they are primarily used for collaborative projects, and also primarily for coding-based projects (although you can use it for basically any type of computer project).)
2. (The concept of branching was probably the most interesting thing I learned. I liked the way it was explained. How it allows for isolation of code, but also allows files to be connected via the transformations it has undergone and uploaded to the repository. )
3. (I learned the process behind using a VCS like Github, how you download from the repository to your workstation, then stage fixes until you find a place you want to save a "snapshot" to your repository by committing.)
