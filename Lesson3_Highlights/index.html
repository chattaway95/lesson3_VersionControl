            <p class="lead">Version control systems are systems that store all of the alterations made to files over time, so that if you need to go back to the project to a point before you made a certain change you still have access to that file (without having to hunt through a bunch of potentially saved-over files). They make it easier to complete a project, both by oneself or with a group of collaborators. They are particularly useful for code-based projects, but can be used for basically any type of file (i.e. digital design, word docs, etc.). It can allow you to see how and when changes were made, compare the befores and afters of those changes, see who made the most recent changes, and who/when an issue was created.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is a place where projects files can be remotely saved and archived. They are most often used for projects involving code, generally for developers, and they are most useful for projects with multiple developers working on the same project, especially if asynchoronously. Git acts as a repository for projects, saving both locally and on the server. With Git, you make changes to the working copy of the project and then upload the changes to the repository. With Git, you begin by creating a skeleton repository, and then you create a "snapshot" by saving the project to the repository at any point you want to record. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Staging</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">With Git, the process essentially goes: tracking, staging, committing. Staging is the step before commit. To stage a file you run the "git add" command, which can be used to begin tracking new files, stage files, and do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. This is like a pre-save, essentially. You are setting it up and working, but until you commit you have not yet saved it to the project overall. It allows you to take a snapshot of the work done in your workstation, but it does not save that snapshot to the repository until it is committed.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #4
                <span class="text-muted">Snapshots</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github focuses a lot on how their system is more like taking snapshots of the work throughout the creation process, which is a unique and much more beneficial way to do things, according to them. Other VCS work with projects by thinking about them in terms of chronological files, so it is more like a view of a complex filesystem than it is simply a storage system. If there have been no changes, you can simply refer back to the last "snapshot" instead of saving and opening up a new file. This way of branching data is a reletively unique approach. This keeps things streamlined and efficient, and helps to make sure that the project has every change recorded and accessible should anything happen or need to be returned to.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Branching</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git makes note of the "branching" or tree-like structure that is unique to it often. This is the key to its ability to work so well with non-linear development, and what makes it so ideal for big collabortaive projects. Branching allows you to continue working on the project without messing with the "main line" of development of the project. Most VCS have some element of branching to them, although Git asserts that for most it is inefficient or too costlybecause it requires you to create a new copy of your source code directory, whereas Git encourages workflows that branch and merge often, creating nearly instantaneous connections..</p>
